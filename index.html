Recently, high cases of diabetes and similar diseases started having and all-time increases of percentage. Around 60 years ago, 
        Diabetes was basically a non-existent disease. Barely anyone had this very inconsipous but dangerous disease. But lately, cases of diabetes have been surging like a tsunami. As of 2014, a study conducted by WHO(World Health Organization) revealed that diabetes cases during 1980 to 2013 were only around 103 million 
        around the world. But suddenly, in 2014 these cases triple in amount to almost 422 million! This cannot be easily overlooked because of the massive increase in cases. What's worse is that in a study conducted in 2019, showed that almost 2 million people have died because of diabetes. And all this is because of people
        having unhealthy diets. Obesity, lack-of exercise, and tobacco are some of the main factors affecting these cases. Our goal is to inspire this generation of youths and people to acknowledge this rising disease and create their own healthy and nutritious diet plan. This is where our Diet Calculator comes in. This Calculator
        used reactjs and ml(with OpenAI as our resource) to create a calculator which takes in various variables such as weight, height, average amount of exercise per day etc. Click on the "DietCalc" to get information to create your own diet plan.</font></font><br> <br> <br>
